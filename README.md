# Vex-Elevator-Project
Taking Lego City's Finest to the Next Level

A past Principles of Engineering project. Working in a team of 4, we designed and built a elevator on the VexV5 platform. Its functions 
include homing the first floor for an infinite numher of floors and a call to any floor. Too small for us unfortunately, but for Lego people
it's fantastic!

Code written and tested by me.
